# üõ†Ô∏è Microservice Project with RabbitMQ, MySQL, MongoDB, and Docker

This project is a microservices-based application built with NestJS that utilizes **RabbitMQ** for inter-service communication. It is composed of two main services:
- **Admin Service** (Product Service): Manages products with **MySQL** and **TypeORM**
- **Main Service**: Listens for product events (`create`, `update`, `delete`) and stores relevant data with **MongoDB**

Both services communicate via RabbitMQ, allowing for a loosely-coupled, event-driven architecture.

## üì¶ Project Structure

- **Admin Service (Product Service)**: Handles product creation, updates, and deletions.
- **Main Service**: Listens to events emitted by the Admin Service, processing these to maintain a synchronized product store.
